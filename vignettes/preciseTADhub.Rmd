# Introduction

`preciseTADhub` is an ExperimentData R package that supplements the `preciseTAD` software R package. `preciseTADhub` offers users access to pre-trained random forest classification models used to predict TAD/loop boundary regions. The model building process introduced by `preciseTAD` (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.03.282186) can be computationally intensive. To avoid this burden, we have provided users with 84 (2 cell lines $\times$ 2 ground truth boundaries $\times$ 21 autosomal chromosomes) .RDS files containing pre-trained models that can be leveraged to predict TAD and/or chromatin loop boundaries at base-level resolution using functionality provided by `preciseTAD` (https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/preciseTAD/inst/doc/preciseTAD.html). 

Each of the 84 files are stored as lists containing two objects: 1) a train object from \code{caret} with RF model information, and 2) a data.frame of variable importance for each genomic annotation included in the model. The file names are structured as follows: 

$i$_$j$_$k$_$l$.rds

where $i$ denotes the chromosome that was used as a holdout {CHR1, CHR2, ..., CHR21, CHR22} (i.e. for testing; meaning all other chromosomes were used for training), j denotes the cell line {GM12878, K562}, k denotes the resolution (size of genomic bins) {5kb, 10kb}, and l denotes the TAD/loop caller used to define ground truth {Arrowhead, Peakachu}.

For example the file named "CHR1_GM12878_5kb_Arrowhead.rds" is a list whose first item is a RF model that was built on data for chromosomes 2-22 (omitting CHR9; see https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.03.282186), binned using 5 kb bins, ground truth TAD boundaries were identified using the Arrowhead TAD caller at 5 kb on GM12878. All models included the same number of predictors including CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143. The second item in the list is a data.frame with variable importances for CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143.

The pre-trained models set up users to apply them to predict their own boundaries on chromosomes that were heldout, per the framework in the preciseTAD paper (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.03.282186).

# Getting Started

The following is an example of how to predict TAD boundaries at base-level resolution for CHR22 on GM12878, using a pre-trained model stored in `preciseTADhub`.

## Installation

```{r}
#if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#    install.packages("BiocManager")
#BiocManager::install(c("ExperimentHub"), version = "3.12")

library(ExperimentHub)
library(preciseTAD)
```

## Reading in a file stored on ExperimentHub

Table 1 shows the file names and the corresponding ExperimentHub (EH) IDs. Since we want to make TAD boundary predictions on CHR22 for GM12878, we opt to read in the "CHR1_GM12878_5kb_Arrowhead.rds" file. This corresponds to the EH3895 EHID.
